   <h1>About Mother Teresa Charities and Missionaries</h1>
   <p>Teresa sought and obtained Vatican permission to start a diocesan congregation, which would become the Missionaries of Charity, after working on the streets of Calcutta for two years. "The poor, the naked, the homeless, the crippled, the blind, the lepers," Teresa explained, "all those people who feel unwanted, unloved, and uncared for in society, people who have become a burden to society and are shunned by others." In Calcutta, it started as a small order of 12 members.</p>
   <p>More than 4,000 nuns ran orphanages, AIDS hospices, and charity centres on all six continents by 2006, caring for refugees, the blind, disabled, elderly, alcoholics, the sick, homeless, and victims of floods, epidemics, and famine</p>
